    <h2>What is Cryptocurrency?</h2>
    <p>
        Cryptocurrecy is a digital asset that is kept completely online. There is no physical version of these currency. All transactions take place completely online. Cryptocurrency is completely decentralized meaning no one organization controls it, like how banks do with fiat currency.

    <h2>How does Cryptocurency work?</h2>
    <p>
        How is this system regulated if it is completely decentralized? Well, there is something called the "blockchain" which is a public ledger that records all transactions that take place on the blockchain. How is this ledger updated you might ask? Well there are people called "miners" run have these supercomuters that solve complex math formulas which verify the transactions; and once they are verfied they are updated as a new "block" on the ledger, hence the "block" in blockchain. Miners are incentivized to run these power-hungry supercomputers because they are rewarded with some coins for verfying these transactions and creating new blocks. Coins are held in a digital wallet. A wallet is essentially just "private key" which is just a really long string of numbers and letters that allow access to this wallet, so whoever knows this sequence of characters owns the wallet. It is also important to note that <b>YOUR PRIVATE KEY CANNOT BE CHANGED</b>, so knowing it is crucial to having access to your funds, otherwise they are lost forever. There are numerous stories of people who have forgotten the private key to their wallets which hold sums of coins that amass to large amounts of wealth (millions of dollars).

    <h2>What are the benefits of Cryptocurrecny?</h2>
    <p>
        There are numerous benefits of Cryptocurrency compared to currency used today. Since the blockchain is public and decentralized, its virtually impossible to hack since you would need to hack every one of the miners at the same time in order to change the ledger. It also cannot be controlled by the government, or anyone for that matter, since it is a decentralized system. So no one can take your money without your permission (unless they know the private key), and the system can never be shut down (as we have seen with Robinhood in the past).
